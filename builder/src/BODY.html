    This is still a prototype, but the basic setup is: Clicking the palettes on
    the side changes the overall color set. The palettes at the top represent
    all the differnt cobinations of the sidebar palette shuffling background,
    body text, link text, and header text. You can also use the keyboard
    shortcuts: `h` Show/hide both palettes - `s` show/hide side palette - `t`
    show/hide top pallet - `up/down arrows` change to next background -
    `left/right arrow` shift header/body/link colors on top of the background.
    (Settings toggle is currently busted)

    The rest of the text is placeholder stuff. A gray mare walked before the
    colt. The bloom of the rose lasts a few days. Twist the valve and release
    hot steam. This horse will nose his way to the finish. A chink in the wall
    allowed a draft to blow. Much of the story makes good sense.

    They took the axe and the saw to the forest. Corn cobs can be used to kindle
    a fire. Throw out the used paper cup and plate.
  </p>
  <p>
    TODO: Finish this test and setup the welcome page. Welcome to the color
    palette explorer. You can click the pallets or use the arrow keys to switch
    colors. You can also click the &quot;hide&quot; button or press
    &quot;h&quot; to hide the pallets to make it easier to focus on how the
    colors look. The arrow keys still work when the palettes are hidden.

  <p>
    Screen the porch with woven straw mats. The drip of the rain made a pleasant
    sound. Pour the stew from the pot into the plate. Oak is strong and also
    gives shade. Take the winding path to reach the lake. The source of the huge
    river is the clear spring.
  </p>

  <p>
    They slice the sausage thin with a knife. A lathe cuts and trims any wood.
    Our plans right now are hazy. A castle built from sand fails to endure. Some
    ads serve to cheat buyers. The doorknob was made of bright clean brass. A
    small creek cut across the field. The curtain rose and the show was on.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ramp led up to the wide highway. No cement will hold hard wood. Smoke
    poured out of every crack. He crawled with care along the ledge. This plank
    was made for walking on. Add salt before you fry the egg. The sofa cushion
    is red and of light weight. Pluck the bright rose without leaves. Split the
    log with a quick, sharp blow. The ink stain dried on the finished page. The
    colt reared and threw the tall rider.
  </p>

  <h2>A Small Creek</h2>

  <p>
    The point of the steel pen was bent and twisted. No hardship seemed to keep
    him sad. The sun came up to light the eastern sky. The lake sparkled in the
    red hot sun. Jazz and swing fans like fast music. Bring your best compass to
    the third class. Torn scraps littered the stone floor.
  </p>

  <h2>The Stone Fence</h2>
  <p>
    The paper box is full of thumb tacks. Lift the square stone over the fence.

    Once we stood beside the shore. Tend the sheep while the dog wanders. Just
    hoist it up and take it away, He wrote his last novel there at the inn. The
    tree top waved in a graceful way. There are more than two factors here.
    Those words were the cue for the actor to leave.
  </p>

  <p>
    The man wore a feather in his felt hat. Breakfast buns are fine with a hot
    drink. Raise the sail and steer the ship northward. Write at once or you may
    forget it. At that high level the air is pure. The ripe taste of cheese
    improves with age. A wisp of cloud hung in the blue air. The dune rose from
    the edge of the water. It snowed, rained, and hailed the same morning. The
    birch canoe slid on the smooth planks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Say it slowly but make it ring clear. Draw the chart with heavy black lines.
    Soap can wash most dirt away. Tack the strip of carpet to the worn floor.
    The map had an X that meant nothing. The petals fall with the next puff of
    wind. The jacket hung on the back of the wide chair. He ordered peach pie
    with ice cream. Open the crate but don't break the glass. Use a pencil to
    write the first draft.
  </p>

  <p>
    Drop the ashes on the worn old rug. Seed is needed to plant the spring corn.
    There is a lag between thought and act. The list of names is carved around
    the base. The thaw came early and freed the stream. It takes a good trap to
    capture a bear. He carved a head from the round block of marble. We admire
    and love a good cook. The cup cracked and spilled its contents. A saw is a
    tool used for making boards. The wide road shimmered in the hot sun.
  </p>

  <p>
    He wrote down a long list of items. Mark the spot with a sign painted red.
    Let it burn, it gives us warmth and comfort. He used the lathe to make brass
    objects. Ducks fly north but lack a compass. It is hard to erase blue or red
    ink. The coffee stand is too high for the couch. The cigar burned a hole in
    the desk top. The salt breeze came across from the sea.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hats are worn to tea and not to dinner. Roads are paved with sticky tar. The
    key you designed will fit the lock. The logs fell and tumbled into the clear
    stream. These thistles bend in a high wind.
  </p>

  <p>
    The desk and both chairs were painted tan. The sheep were led home by a dog.
    Feed the white mouse some flower seeds. Where were they when the noise
    started. The office paint was a dull sad tan. The urge to write short
    stories is rare. The grass curled around the fence post. The fruit peel was
    cut in thick slices. Rice is often served in round bowls.
  </p>

  <p>
    The marsh will freeze when cold enough. The dry wax protects the deep
    scratch. Jerk the dart from the cork target. It's a dense crowd in two
    distinct ways. He took the lead and kept it the whole distance. The pencils
    have all been used. A salt pickle tastes fine with ham. The young kid jumped
    the rusty gate. The pipe began to rust while new.
  </p>

  <p>
    He wheeled the bike past the winding road. We now have a new base for
    shipping. The fur of cats goes by many names. He broke a new shoelace that
    day. The frosty air passed through the coat. It's easy to tell the depth of
    a well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bottles hold four kinds of rum. Beat the dust from the rug onto the lawn.
    The sand drifts over the sill of the old house. That move means the game is
    over. The houses are built of red clay bricks. The spot on the blotter was
    made by green ink. Guess the results from the first scores.
  </p>

  <p>
    The straw nest housed five robins. Fasten two pins on each side. Each penny
    shone like new. A fresh start will work such wonders. Glue the sheet to the
    dark blue background.
  </p>

  <p>
    The dirt piles were lines along the road. On the islands the sea breeze is
    soft and mild. There was a sound of dry leaves outside. Steam hissed from
    the broken valve.
  </p>

  <p>
    A cold dip restores health and zest. A siege will crack the strong defense.
    Go now and come here later. The vane on top of the pole revolved in the
    wind. Weave the carpet on the right hand side. The bark of the pine tree was
    shiny and dark. Cut the pie into large parts. Two blue fish swam in the
    tank.
